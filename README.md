# Status

Current version uses Neuroph library, can learn itself to distinguish between 4 predefined car logos.

UI allows user to draw the picture which is given to the neural network for judgement.

# Todo

Prepare more learning examples as with small amount of data it is very random in many picture configurations.

As learning takes time it should be extracted from the main program and best learned weights should be added as a resource.
